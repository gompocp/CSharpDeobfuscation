# CSharpDeobfuscation
- Simple deobfuscator for a certain Malicious VRChat Mod *cough* begins with 'A' *cough*
- No idea what this obfuscator is called
- Through the power of dnlib it can remove almost 99% of control obfuscation on methods
- It can inline all static methods calls to the `<Module>` class
- Decrypts all strings too and removes the dead methods
- Drag and drop .dll onto the executable
