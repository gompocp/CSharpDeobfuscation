# CSharpDeobfuscation
- Simple deobfuscator for a certain Malicious VRChat Mod *cough* begins with 'A' *cough*
- No idea what this obfuscator is called
- Through the power of dnlib it can remove almost 99% of control obfuscation on methods
- It can inline all static methods calls to the `<Module>` class
- Decrypts all strings too, no idea if the decrypt method changes from running the obfuscator each time but ah well
- Removes the dead methods left behind too
- Drag and drop .dll onto the executable
